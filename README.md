# Breast Cancer Diagnosis - Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using clinical data. The primary goal is to support early diagnosis with a clean, modular, and interpretable machine learning workflow.

## 🧠 Project Overview

* **Dataset**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
* **Problem Type**: Binary Classification
* **Target Variable**: `target` (0 = benign, 1 = malignant) — this was adjusted for clarity
* **Positive Class**: Malignant (`1`)

## 🔍 Notebooks

* **01\_EDA\_Breast\_Cancer.ipynb**: Overview of dataset, distribution of features, diagnosis class balance.
* **02\_Preprocessing\_BreastCancer.ipynb**: Handles missing values, label encoding, feature scaling, and data splits.
* **03\_Modeling\_BreastCancer.ipynb**: Trains and evaluates models (Logistic Regression). Uses accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for evaluation.

## 🧪 Models

| Model               | Accuracy | ROC AUC | Notes                         |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.97     | 0.99    | Baseline model                |
